# Why choosing the right apps matters


# App Store

Using a trustworthy app store is the first step to a safer, privacy and security friendly Android experience.

F-Droid is an open source Android app store that applies strict rules on included apps - including tests to
make sure the does not spy on you, has not trackers and so on. You probably won't find a place where you can
be as sure as here that the apps you get are safe to use.

If you have more questions, refer to [F-Droid's FAQ](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/FAQ_-_General/).


## Installation

Download the F-Droid APK from the [official website](https://f-droid.org/en/). Do not install it directly from 
the downloads section (you don't want your browser to have permission to install apps). Open your file manager,
navigate to your downloads folder and open `F-Droid.apk`. Now give your file manager the permission to install
apps from unknown sources and install it. After the installation has finished, withraw the permission from your
file manager again. We don't need it anymore.

Now open **F-Droid** and draw the first page from the top. This will refresh the package sources and check if
there is an update for F-Droid. If so, you'll see a bubble with a number on the bell icon in the tool bar at
the bottom. Click it and apply the update.

You will have to give F-Droid the permission to install apps from unknown sources. Keep it like that.

After restarting F-Droid you are ready to explore its list of apps and install whatever you like.
