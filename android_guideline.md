# Why choosing the right apps matters

Closed source apps often contain trackers to display the the right advertisements, identify you throughout
the web, to analyze where you go, what you like and who you know. This might seem ok, as long as the only
use is to display you the right advertisements. But this means you allow anyone to known almost anything
about you. 

Its not about seeing no ads but has much wider implications like freedom and human rights. Enough has been
written on the matter and I don't want to do it again here.

# App Store

Using a trustworthy app store is the first step to a safer, privacy and security friendly Android experience.

F-Droid is an open source Android app store that applies strict rules on included apps - including tests to
make sure the does not spy on you, has not trackers and so on. You probably won't find a place where you can
be as sure as here that the apps you get are safe to use.

If you have more questions, refer to [F-Droid's FAQ](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/FAQ_-_General/).


## Installation

Download the F-Droid APK from the [official website](https://f-droid.org/en/). Do not install it directly from 
the downloads section (you don't want your browser to have permission to install apps). Open your file manager,
navigate to your downloads folder and open `F-Droid.apk`. Now give your file manager the permission to install
apps from unknown sources and install it. After the installation has finished, withraw the permission from your
file manager again. We don't need it anymore.

Now open **F-Droid** and draw the first page from the top. This will refresh the package sources and check if
there is an update for F-Droid. If so, you'll see a bubble with a number on the bell icon in the tool bar at
the bottom. Click it and apply the update.

You will have to give F-Droid the permission to install apps from unknown sources. Keep it like that.

After restarting F-Droid you are ready to explore its list of apps and install whatever you like.

privacy and security aspects. Every app is able to replace your pre-installed app for the specific task.

Each entry contains information about:
